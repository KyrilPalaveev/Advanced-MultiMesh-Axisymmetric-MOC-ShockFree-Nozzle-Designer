# Advanced-MultiMesh-Axisymmetric-MOC-ShockFree-Nozzle-Designer
This is the repository for the further work mentioned in the paper published on my previous repository - the first implementation of axisymmetric method of characteristics. As part of my Final Year Project, the nozzle designing procedure is optimized by introducing new boundary conditions upon which multiple characteristic nets are constructed - the transonic region and the boundary region. The software will be available soon (End of Feb)!
